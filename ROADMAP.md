- [ ] **Character Build Planner** — Set all skills, perks, spells to match a build template

- [ ] **Spawn NPC From Blueprint** — Create a new NPC at runtime using a character blueprint's face morphs, stats, skills, perks, spells, and equipment. Add to `CurrentFollowerFaction` (0x0005C84E) + set relationship rank for follower behavior. Assign a voice type. Steps: create TESNPC form → set face data (19 morphs + head parts) → set race/sex → place reference in world → apply stats/perks/spells → add/equip items → configure follower AI. Optionally use NFF template NPC as base for cleaner persistence. Runtime NPCs get `FFxxxxxx` FormIDs — persistence across saves needs testing.

- [ ] **Event System** — Subscribe to game events (level up, quest complete, combat start/end, cell change) via SKSE event sinks
- [ ] **Multi-client** — Support multiple MCP clients simultaneously (Claude + other tools)
